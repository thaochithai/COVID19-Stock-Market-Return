## Project Objectives

This project investigates the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government lockdown policy on Vietnam's stock market performance. The study examines five major stock indices across Vietnam's three stock exchanges (Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange, Hanoi Stock Exchange, and Unlisted Public Company Market) during the first wave of the pandemic from January to October 2020. Using both event study methodology and GARCH family models, this project analyzes stock returns and volatility in response to COVID-19 case announcements and government intervention measures. The questions that I am looking for the answer are:

1. Does the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly the daily growth in confirmed cases, affect Vietnam's stock market returns?
2. How does the market respond to the government's lockdown policy implementation?
3. What changes in stock market volatility occur during the COVID-19 pandemic?
4. Does the lockdown policy influence stock market volatility?

## Highlights of Findings
Results reveal that the stock market **responded negatively to COVID-19 cases but showed positive reactions to the national lockdown**. Volatility analysis demonstrates **increased market fluctuations** during the pre-lockdown period and decreased volatility after lockdown measures were lifted, indicating that timely government intervention helped restore investor confidence.

- **Event Study Analysis**
  - The Vietnam stock market and its five investigated indices experienced **significant adverse impacts** from the COVID-19 outbreak, evidenced by **excessive negative abnormal returns (AR and AAR)** during the event window.
  - An increase in reported **COVID-19 cases** led to a corresponding **increase in negative AR and ARR**.
  - **Stock returns improved during the lockdown period**, reflecting the effectiveness of the Vietnamese government's drastic policy responses in alleviating market fears and uncertainty.

- **GARCH Models Analysis**
  - The application of the GARCH family of models revealed significant changes in market volatility as well as ** leverage effects.**
  - Positive and significant pre-lockdown coefficients indicate heightened volatility before the implementation of nationwide physical distancing.
  - Negative and significant post-lockdown coefficients suggest that market volatility decreased following the lockdown measures.
  - The market demonstrated asymmetric volatility—negative news has a greater impact on volatility than positive news.
  - **Evidence of mean reversion is observed**, with the sum of the ARCH and GARCH coefficients being lower than one (except in the case of EGARCH (1,1)).

## Methodology

This research employs two complementary methodologies to thoroughly analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the Vietnam stock market:

### Methodology 1: The Event Study

| Variable | Definition | Period |
|----------|------------|--------|
| R<sub>i,t</sub> | The daily return of index i on day t calculated using the natural logarithm:<br>R<sub>i,t</sub> = ln(P<sub>i,t</sub>/P<sub>i,t-1</sub>) | June 25th, 2019 - April 23rd, 2020 |
| AR<sub>i,t</sub> | The abnormal return of the individual index, calculated by the mean adjusted model, subtracting the mean return of the index from the daily return of the index:<br>AR<sub>i,t</sub> = R<sub>i,t</sub> - R̄<sub>i</sub> | June 25th, 2019 - April 23rd, 2020 |
| AAR<sub>t</sub> | The average abnormal return is the mean abnormal return of all indices on each event day of the event window:<br>AAR<sub>t</sub> = (1/N)∑<sub>t=1</sub><sup>N</sup>AR<sub>i,t</sub> | June 25th, 2019 - April 23rd, 2020 |
| CAR<sub>i</sub> | The cumulative abnormal return of individual index over a window from t<sub>0</sub> to t<sub>1</sub> is derived by summation of abnormal return over the same window:<br>CAR<sub>i</sub>(t<sub>0</sub>,t<sub>1</sub>) = ∑<sub>t=t<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>t<sub>1</sub></sup>AR<sub>i,t</sub> | June 25th, 2019 - April 23rd, 2020 |
| CAAR<sub>t</sub> | The cumulative average abnormal return aggregates the daily AARs:<br>CAAR<sub>t</sub> = ∑<sub>t=t<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>t<sub>1</sub></sup>AAR<sub>t</sub> | June 25th, 2019 - April 23rd, 2020 |

The event study methodology is used to capture the impact of COVID-19 cases on stock market returns. Key components include:

#### Event Definition
- **Event Date**: January 30th, 2020 (first trading day after initial COVID-19 case announcement)
- **Estimation Window**: 150 trading days prior to the event date (June 25th, 2019, to January 22nd, 2020)
- **Event Window**: 59 days following the event date (January 30th, 2020, to April 23rd, 2020)
- **Sub-event Windows**: Divided into six 10-day windows to analyze different stages of the pandemic's impact

#### Return Calculation
- **Mean Adjusted Return Model**: Used to calculate abnormal returns (AR)
- **Variables Calculated**:
  - Abnormal Returns (AR)
  - Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR)
  - Average Abnormal Returns (AAR)
  - Cumulative Average Abnormal Returns (CAAR)

#### Statistical Testing
- **Student t-test**: Applied to test the significance of ARs and CARs

#### Methodology 2: GARCH Family Models
GARCH family models are employed to analyze stock market volatility before and after the lockdown policy implementation.

| Variable | Definition | Period |
|----------|------------|--------|
| R<sub>i,t</sub> | The daily return of the index on day t calculated using the natural logarithm:<br>R<sub>i,t</sub> = ln(P<sub>i,t</sub>/P<sub>i,t-1</sub>) | January 30th, 2020 - October 30th, 2020 |
| Pre-lock | Dummy variable representing the period before the implementation of nation-wide lockdown policy. The value of the variable is equal to 1 if the date is before April 1st, 2020; 0 otherwise | January 30th, 2020 - March 31st, 2020 |
| After-lock | Dummy variable representing the period after the implementation of nation-wide lockdown policy. The value of the variable is equal to 1 if the date is after April 15th, 2020; 0 otherwise | April 15th, 2020 - October 30th, 2020 |

#### Models Implemented
1. **GARCH(1,1)**: Basic model measuring conditional variance
2. **EGARCH(1,1)**: Exponential GARCH capturing asymmetric volatility responses
3. **GJR-GARCH(1,1)**: Alternative asymmetric model with leverage effect

#### Model Specifications
All models include:
- **Mean Equation**: Incorporating lockdown dummy variables
- **Variance Equation**: Measuring volatility with ARCH and GARCH effects
- **Dummy Variables**:
  - Pre-lock: Value of 1 if date is before April 1st, 2020; 0 otherwise
  - After-lock: Value of 1 if date is after April 15th, 2020; 0 otherwise

#### Model Evaluation
- **Information Criteria**: AIC and BIC for model comparison
- **Specification Tests**: Including stationary test (ADF), serial correlation test (Ljung-Box), normality test (Jarque-Bera), and ARCH effect test

## Key Findings

### Impact of COVID-19 Cases on Stock Returns
- All five stock indices showed negative abnormal returns (AR) on the event date (January 30th, 2020)
- VNI and VNI30 were most vulnerable, with one-day percentage losses of -3.288% and -3.758% respectively
- Negative cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) persisted throughout most event windows, intensifying during periods with high case numbers
- Daily growth in confirmed cases consistently corresponded with negative market returns

### Effect of Lockdown Policy on Market Returns
- Positive and significant abnormal returns during the lockdown period (April 1-15, 2020)
- All indices earned positive CARs at a significant level of 1% after the implementation of lockdown
- VNI's CAR reached 9.475% during the event window (40-49), coinciding with the lockdown period
- Market recovery signals were evident following government intervention

### Volatility Analysis
- Strong evidence of volatility clustering in all return series
- Increased volatility before the lockdown implementation (positive pre-lock coefficient)
- Decreased volatility after the lockdown period (negative after-lock coefficient)
- Evidence of leverage effect where negative shocks had larger impacts than positive news
- Mean-reverting behavior with the sum of ARCH and GARCH coefficients below 1 in most models

### Model Performance
- GARCH(1,1) provided the most consistent results across all indices
- Evidence of asymmetric volatility across most indices and models
- Information criteria suggested EGARCH(1,1) as the best-fitting model theoretically

## Results and Visualizations

### Event Study Results
The event study is conducted over a period of 150 days before and 59 days after the event date, which is the first trading day of 2020 in presence of the first COVID-19 cases. The timespan is from June 25th, 2020 to April 23rd, 2020. The following sections delve into the stock market return on event data and particular event window to derive the implications of whether the occurrence and the increase of confirmed COVID-19 cases have any impacts on the stock market. 

#### Abnormal Return of Indices over the event window 0 to 59
| Index    | AR on Day Before (t=-1) | AR on Event Date (t=0) | AR on Day After (t=1) |
|----------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| VNI      | 0.495%                  | -3.288%***             | -2.441%***            |
| VNI30    | 0.253%                  | -3.758%***             | -3.184%***            |
| HNXI     | 0.642%                  | -2.072%***             | -1.705%***            |
| HNXI30   | 1.677%                  | -2.634%***             | -2.311%***            |
| UPCOMI   | 0.451%                  | -0.888%**              | -1.095%**             |

> The AR on the event day t0, which is the first trading day of the Vietnam stock market after the first COVID-19 cases are confirmed and following day t1 are unveiled in Table below. On the event date, all the stock indices showed a negative AR opposing to the previous day of positive ARs due to the mass coronavirus-induced selloffs by investors.VNI and VNI30 are the most vulnerable indices carrying the one-day percentage losses of -3.288% and -3.758% respectively. Tracing back to HOSE where the VNI is originated, the event date witnessed an overwhelming loss for 274 stocks out of the total listed companies. Similar pattern is also spotted in VNI30 with 27 tickers tumbling, and solely 1 gaining. In the key Asian stock market, the fall of Japan’s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, and South Korea’s Kospi is recorded at 1.72%, 2.6%, and 1.71% sequentially. VNI’s movement is likely to reflect negative sentiments of the regional markets.

*Note: AR(i,t) is the abnormal return of the index i on day t. Daily abnormal returns are calculated using the mean adjusted model from June 25th, 2020 to April 23rd, 2020. VNI, VNI30, HNXI, HNXI30, and UPCOMPI is the abbreviation of VN-Index, VN30-Index, HNX-Index, HNX-30 Index and UPCOM-Index respectively. t=0 is the event date January 30th, 2020.; t =1 is one day after the event date.

| Index    | CAR (0-9)    | CAR (10-19)  | CAR (20-29)   | CAR (30-39)   | CAR (40-49)   | CAR (50-59)   |
|----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| VNI      | -5.772%***   | -4.745%***   | -10.116%***   | -16.360%***   | 9.475%***     | 1.575%***     |

| HNXI30   | 0.946%       | -1.284%*     | 1.593%**      | -3.939%***    | 8.855%***     | 2.679%***     |
| UPCOMI   | -0.681%      | -1.153%**    | -5.434%***    | -5.913%***    | 2.285%***     | 1.824%***     |

> After 10 straight days without new cases, the confirmed cases rise rapidly with the highest number of cases during (20-29) and (30-39) of 4 and 24 respectively. The highly significant and negative CARs in the presence of increased COVID-19 cases support that new cases induced fear and transmitted negative signals across the market dragging the returns of all indices.

> Outstanding CARs in the window (40-49) is potentially the result of nationwide lockdown by the Vietnamese government. The policy spans over day 44 to day 53, matching the window (40-49). The highly significant and positive CARs in the lockdown period supports the alternative of Hypothesis (2), hence, concluding the positive impacts of lockdown policy on the stock market return. Despite the growth in COVID-19 cases during this period, the physical distancing enforced by the government has potentially cushioned the investors’ sentiments and strengthen their beliefs, consequently ushering the revision of the stock market. 

*Note: *** Significant at 1% level, ** Significant at 5% level, * Significant at 10% level*

### GARCH Models Results
This methodology is targeted to investigate the volatility of stock market return, in particular, the period before and after the lockdown policy takes effect.

> The high value for α+β means the shock will perpetuate the changes in volatility in the long run. In other words, the overall α + β implies possible lasting effects in the future values of σ_t^2, resulting in a persistent conditional variance. Furthermore, the sum of ARCH and GARCH effects also determine the speed at which the stock returns move to their average values, alternatively, the mean reversion speed. It can be observed from Table above that all five indices exhibit a mean-reverting process as the sum of α,β coefficients are below 1 except for VNI and HNX30 in the EGARCH (1,1) model. Thus, all indices will gravitate towards their previous mean after a certain amount of time. Moreover, the higher the value, the longer it takes for mean reversion. It is noticeable that in the GARCH (1,1) model, VNI is the fastest to revert to its mean value, meanwhile, the remaining models suggest the UPCOM

> Regarding the regression results presented in Table above, it is apparent that the volatility of the stock market is variable in the period before and after the implementation of the lockdown policy. Specifically, the volatility increases before the lockdown policy take effect while decrease after it ended. Vietnamese government's swift and astute actions in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic has relieved the fears and pessimism lingering in the market. It acts as pain relief to the increasing uncertainty of the market and helps drive down the volatility and reverse the negative mean return. It is evidenced by the rejuvenation of VN-Index after the lockdown.

### Leverage Effects in GARCH Models

#### Asymmetric Effects (γ)
The leverage effect is the negative relationship between asset value and volatility. It is knowingly referred to as asymmetric volatility between the market downturn and upturn. In specific, the volatility tends to increase by a larger amount towards negative shock or bad news rather than positive shocks or good news (Black, 1976). It is manifested by the positive sign of γ in GJR-GARCH (1,1) models and the negative sign in the EGARCH (1,1) model. 

| Index    | EGARCH(1,1)     | GJR-GARCH(1,1)  |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| VNI      | -0.159766***    | 0.201302***     |
|          | [0.000]         | [0.000]         |

*Note: *** Significant at 1% level, ** Significant at 5% level, * Significant at 10% level. Values in [brackets] represent p-values.*

> The asymmetric term of all four indices are statistically significant in both models, carrying the negative sign in EGARCH (1,1), and positive sign GJR-GARCH (1,1). Therefore, there is evidence of the leverage effect in the Vietnam stock market. This finding is consistent with past research by Chang et al. (2009) on the volatility of the stock market and exchange rate, Nguyen at al. (2019) with the discovery of asymmetric effects (leverage) on HOSE using TGARCH model (1,1), yet, contradicts research by Tran (2011) suggesting the symmetric pattern of volatility and Ibrahim (2011) on 6 ASEAN stock markets including Vietnam using GARCH-in mean.
> In the context of this study, it can be inferred from the result that the COVID-19 pandemic as bad news places a larger effect on the Vietnam stock market returns than the lockdown policy as good news. This further confirms the finding in the previous section using the event study. The lockdown policy soothes the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the market, however, its influences are not strong enough to completely offset the negative shocks.

### Model Selection
As discussed in the previous sub-sections, each model generated different results for each index. The results might be inconsistent within models in a certain case. Therefore, the selection of a suitable model for the data is important in interpreting the results.The analysis involves comparing these criteria across models to determine the most suitable model for each index.

- **AIC (Akaike Information Criterion):** A metric that rewards goodness of fit but includes a penalty for increasing the number of parameters in the model.
- **BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion):** Similar to AIC but with a higher penalty for models with more parameters, favoring more parsimonious models.
- **Log Likelihood:** Measures the probability of the observed data given the model parameters; higher values indicate a better fit.

> Generally, the model with lower AIC and BIC is the better model. Regarding the AIC and BIC, EGARCH(1,1) is the best fit carrying the lowest value for all five indices. However, from the regression result. However, given the regression results of three GARCH family of models on five stock indices in the Vietnam stock market, GARCH (1,1) is deemed to generate more reliable and consistent results in comparison with the remaining two. Choosing a model over another depending solely on the AIC and BIC is not completely comprehensive and accurate since it is susceptible to the over-fitting problem. Furthermore, each market has different characteristics that might be compatible with particular models. Several types of research on the Vietnam stock market have found that GARCH (1,1) and EGARCH (1,1) models are the most appropriate to measure the volatility of VN-Index (Ngo et al., 2017; Nguyen and Nguyen, 2019). The empirical results of Nguyen and Darné (2018) on VNI and HNX suggest FIAPARCH as the most suitable model. Whereas, Tuyen (2011) concluded that standard GARCH (0,1) is the best to capture the market volatility. Most studies define GARCH (1,1) as a standardized method for assessing volatility, however, it only describes the impact on the mean and variance while in the dearth of the ability to measure the asymmetric volatility.
